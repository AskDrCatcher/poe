# Human / Nature or Nature / Human

> dedicated to the firecat that bristled in the way.

Thousand rays of sun shine inside me,  
compared to million on a blade of grass;  
somewhere in the grassy field, a caterpillar dies,  
under the feet of a playful child.  

A genius violinist in the midst of applauding crowd,  
harp his instrument against the soundless buzz of bee overtone;  
the fallen flowers of baldcypress rise like a tide in the wind,  
just before the childish bubble could rise above the ground.  

The group of mourners took a pause,  
while the sky gave way to thunderous outpourings;  
a women gave birth to a child with pangs of pain,  
when a suitcase of cash is exchanged thousand of miles away.  

He was planning a while to tell her first,  
what she already know through intuition;  
A crocodile in the swamp closes its eyes,  
when a thief enters the house of the victim.
